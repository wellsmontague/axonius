<h2>About This Repository</h2>
I am not a coder!  So, here you will find lots of randomness that is hopefully well documented and that you will find valuable.  Over time, I will make this so we can all contribute.  Until then.....
<p>
* The <b>random_user_csv_data.py</b> will ask you to enter the number of results you want for your CSV data file and then use that to generate an output.csv file with that many rows of the following random data fields: domain, firstname, id, lastname, mail, name, endpointname, username.  From here, you can easily use the output.csv file to propagate your adapter connection with data to query off of and build dashboards and such.  Hope it helps.
